current:What's the craziest thing you've seen on this job?
tsa3: Yo Mama.
current: No, seriously.
tsa2: One time i saw this humongous lady come through here. We were worried that she was too big for the SR-90.
tsa2: So we had to build a cage to box her in and make sure that she didnt leave any love handles behind. But she was still seeping out of it.
tsa2: In the end, we had to bring in a second machine and send her through twice.
current: Oh wow, she must really HAVE been huge.
tsa2: That's right, yo mama so fat we had to teleport her TWICE.
current: COME ON!
