the coffee machine in our office is broken. Looking for new coffe machine
The Scrimbo Times does not take failure lightly. That has always been true of our noble paper.

Recently, our coffee machine broke and there seems to be no fix. Stebe has repeatedly tried to fix it by making more coffee, but it still does not make coffee. We don't know why.

No, we have not contacted Keurig, our coffee machine creator, about the repair. Why should we? It should be fixed and working because we bought it that way, but isn't.

As this article is being written, I can see Larry, Mior, Donnatello, Kir, Linder, Hreath, Trippy, Dippy, Smippy, and Count Gorgo at the coffee machine waiting for coffee. They have been waiting for days, but the coffee is still not coming. I wish I could give you good news, but there is none. There will be no
<NEWCOLUMN>
coffee. There may never be again.

We recently changed coffee bean providers, but those beans have not shown up yet. We are forced to not use our old beans because the coffee machine, as stated earlier, is broken. We require it fixed.

Now we come to the grand point. We believe that the coffee machine never actually worked. Nobdy remembers having coffee, and nobody even want it. How come it doesn't work then? Don't things break because we use them. If we never use them, why doesnt it work. Also, we never even know how to make it work. We believe it should just WORK!

If Scrimbo Times does not get a working coffee machine, we will kill people. And we take that statement and plaster it on you. We will kill you if you don't fix. Keurig is not the problem. It is you.
