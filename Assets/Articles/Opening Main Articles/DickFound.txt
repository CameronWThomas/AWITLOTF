SR-90S FIXABLE! DISCOVERED CROAK GRIMBO LETTER NAMES WHO CAN FIX THE SR-90S
During the cataloging process of the estate of the late inventor of the SR-90, Croak Grimbo, a letter was found indicating that his nephew, Dick Grimbo, has been specially trained in calibrating SR-90s.

The letter is as follows:

"My dear sweet boy, Dick. You may not know, but I have been covertly teaching you all the secrets of the SR-90. You know its ways. You can feel its energies. It all relates to the THREE COMPONENTS of a human: the BODY, the MIND, and the SPIRIT.

A time will come where the SR-90s will begin to fail and Evergency will begin. At such a time, you need begin the calibration process. This calibration process will require you to show the machines how to take the THREE COMPONENTS and combine them to an optimal form needed for transportation. This
<NEWCOLUMN>
process will need to be repeated every 10 years for 30 years.

Be careful, my dearest Dick, for you are teaching the machines, and the machines must know how to reform the THREE COMPONENTS. If you teach them wrong, the purity of the THREE COMPONENTS, will be corrupted.

I'm counting on you,
Uncle Croak"

Travel officials have informed us that Dick has been discovered on the Galapagos islands and will return to calibrate the machines.

If you are reading this, Dick, we at the Scrimbo times are rooting for you. We can't go back to planes. Theyre lame. Save the SR-90s! Save the dream!
