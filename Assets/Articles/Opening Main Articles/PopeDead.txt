POPE DEAD DUE TO A MALFUNCTIONING SR-90
After attending a war summit in Dover, Delaware on Tuesday evening, Pontiff Lasagna Everett died due to what appears to be a malfunctioning SR-90 Transporter.  His eminence went to New Croakton International Causeway to travel to St. Bartleby Holy Seminary where he would reconsecrate the grounds. Visitors of the seminary waited outside the destination SR-90 to welcome the Pontiff.

Witnesses stated there was a buzz in the air shortly before the flash of the destination SR-90. After the flash, what was left was described by one witness as "bones and blood and meat and stuff".

Initial assumptions appear to be the long thought theoretical phenomenon of Eversion, when an SR-90 reconsititutes users inside out. Recently deceased creator, Croak Grimbo, warned of such a possiblilty

in the final years of his life.

His eminence was an outspoken supporter of the SR-90s, often referring to them as a "divine tool". He played a vital role towards the Keen's Initiative, a $315 trillion investment in replacing air based commercial travel with SR-90s. This support drew controversy due to his personal connection Grimbo.

World travel officials have begun an inquiry into what caused this disaster and have placed a halt on all SR-90s based travel. Due to the lack of SR-90 experts, officials have stated there is little hope in a full understanding.

It is unknown how long the halt on SR-90 based travel will last, but one insider told The Scrimbo Times, "I doubt the SR-90s will be down for long".
