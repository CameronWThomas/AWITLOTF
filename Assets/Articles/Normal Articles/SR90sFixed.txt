SR-90s appear fixed! Dick to be given medal of Sweets by president fugue
The courageous efforts of Dick Grimbo to re-calibrate the SR-90s appears to be a massive success! SR-90s are back in working order and there have been no further signs of evergency.

President Fugue has already announced that Dick will be given the Medal of Sweets, the highest honor a judgemental patriot can be given. Fugue stated "I believe that the future is safely in our hands after the efforts of Dick. I intend to appoint Dick as the Head of Transportation when I get around to it". 

In a recent press conference, Croak Grimbo's late wife, Critter D'Angelo Grimbo, expressed gratitude to Dick for his efforts. Dick and Critter have been estranged for decades following a "tussle", as Croak's offical biographer referred to it.

We at the the Scrimbo Times wish to personally thank Dick. Without the SR-90s being brought back to working order, we believe that things would probably be bad. Thank you, Dick. We appreciate all that Dick did.

Dick, when asked about how he feels about his accomplishments, stated that, "I'm just grateful to hold up the Croak Grimbo legacy".
