SR-90s to be recalled?
In a recent interview with Medley Magazine, President Fugue spoke of personal concerns he has with the SR-90s and the possibility of issuing a recall. He stated that he has "ordered the administration too look into these concerns and keep the possibility of the recall on the table".

Travel officials appear to have been blindsided by the annoucement. Shortly after the release of the interview, the World Travel Agency issued the following statement: "We believe that SR-90s have no problems at all, and to express any concerns whatsoever is dumb. We intend to use our full legal power to bury Fugue in the dirt with the worms".

The Grimbo family has already begun negotiations with President Fugue to figure out a way to handle his concerns with the SR-90s. Insiders in the Grimbo family have told the Scrimbo Times that the core

issues President Fugue has with the SR-90s is that they are smelly and he doesn't like standing. Critter,  matriarch of the Grimbo family, is allegedly contacting Glade in an attempt to fix the first issue and is getting the president new shoes for the second.

Dick Grimbo, Medal of Sweets recipient and calibrator of the SR-90s, was asked about his thoughts on the possibility of a recall. He stated that he "only cares about one thing: keeping the SR-90s calibrated". It has been 30 years since the death of Pontiff Lasagna Everret and the repairs of the SR-90s. In the following days, Dick will perform the final calibration that will keep the SR-90s working for the remainder of time. 

The use of SR-90s has only become more vital in the past few decades. It is unclear at the time what could possibly replace them if they were to be recalled.
