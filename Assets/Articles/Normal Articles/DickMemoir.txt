Dick: One Wave At A Time
Dick Grimbo, once a lowly Galapagos island dwelling man, has soared to even higher heights than his late uncle Croak Grimbo, the creator of the SR-90.

It was but 30 years ago when Dick was tasked with recalibrating the SR-90s after the evergent event of the late Pontiff Lasagna Everett. Since then, the SR-90s have been in perfect working order and humanity has only prospered.

In his memoir, One Wave at a Time, Dick wrote of the dangers that the SR-90s could have presented mankind beyond just evergency. Apparently, the three components discussed in the famous "Dick Letter" are core components to how the SR-90s reconstitute people. If any of the three components are reassmble inpropertly, that mistake could ripple through humanity leaving us in a state where our bodies become increasingly less familiar, our spirits

corrupted, and our minds left scrambled.

Luckily for us, we had Dick.

Dick now lives on the moon, having a personal SR-90 at his lunar base. He has told reporters that he "feels more at home among the stars, for they are more like him than man".

While his memoir has become the greatest selling book of all time and received near universal acclaim, one member of the Grimbo family has been a negative nancy about it. Slick Grimbo, the late Croak Grimbo's brother and Dick Grimbo's father, has stated that the SR-90s may not be as safe as they seem and the calibration efforts Dick made only serve to slow down the degeneration process Dick warned could have happened. Shortly after Slick made these comments, he was found dead in his bathtub.
