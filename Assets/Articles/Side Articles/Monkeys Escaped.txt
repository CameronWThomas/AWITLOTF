MONKEYS LOOSE FROM ZOO
This just in, monkeys have escaped the zoo. They're causing a ruckuss in downtown Pocopson.

Residents have been told to try and appease them with locally grown fruits and vegetables. Store bought vegetables will be seen as a sign of aggression by the apes. Store bought fruit will cause other far more dangerous emotions to arrise.

Please help all elderly in their encounters with the creatures. Old people have been known to be the targets of the apes.

We at The Scrimbo Times have recently bought a gun and intend to use it if any of the primates decide to enter our office. We also extend this warning to all local residents. You WILL be shot upon entry to our office as this situation is active.
