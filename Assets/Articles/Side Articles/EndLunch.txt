NEW SCHOOL INITIATIVE TO END LUNCH
Don't go packing your kids lunches just yet if you live in Hartford County. School officials have recently decided to no longer allow students to eat lunch during school hours.

Lunch periods are being replaced with what is called "Grunch" period. A school district representative was asked to clarify what exaclty "Grunch" is, but refused to answer.

All parents are being informed to pack needles and hammers rather than lunch for their children. Needles are to be inserted into corks for safety and hammers are to be wielded by the children at all times. What the need of needles and hammers during Grunch period is unclear.

There is a planned assembly on the 14th of June at Shrim's Dojo where school officials will hear all complaints and joys.
