NEW ORGAN DISCOVERED
After a recent autopsy of a Poughkeepsie native, a organ previously unknown in human anatomy was discovered. 

The organ, now known as a Squip, appears to regulate the production of slime. Dr. Emmet Memmet says, "The rate of slime created by the Asquid (new organ #5), has been a great cause of concern within the medical community. As we all know, excessive amounts of slime inside the body has contributed to countless deaths due it's characteristic of building up in the feet.  The Squip aborbs this slime and produces a new substance that the body naturally secretes through our buttholes".

The new substance created by the Squip has yet to be given an official name, but people who have developed the Squip already have nicknamed it "Fire Goo" due to the burning sensation it causes. The

cause of the burning has yet to be understood.

This comes on the heals of the discovery of the Lampus Morgulus, a bone that encompasses the heart and grows incresingly smaller with time. Medical researches believe that the "Fire Goo" may be able to halt the decrease in size of the Lampus Morgulus. However, rumours of a new chest hatch may eleviate the problems caused by the Lampus Morgulus already.

Scientists are noticing the rate of addition of new biological features within the human body are increasing. In fact, it is believed that there may even be humans who no longer resemeble anything human at all.
